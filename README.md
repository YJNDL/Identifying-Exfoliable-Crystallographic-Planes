# High-throughput exfoliation

Bond density evaluation and crystallographic plane selection
    
	1) Use xxx.py to simulate the XRD diffraction pattern of the material.

	2) Apply XXX.py to identify the crystal plane indices corresponding to the diffraction peaks.

	3) Use XXX.py to perform a bond density scan on the specified crystal planes obtained in Step 2.

Step-wise exfoliation

	1) Rotate the structure so that the crystal face to be peeled faces the c-axis.
		
	2) Stretch the lattice along the direction normal to the crystal face, with the outermost atomic layer movement by ~0.2 Ã… at each step.
