# High-throughput exfoliation

Step 1: Use VESTA to simulate the XRD diffraction pattern of the material.
Step 2: Apply XXX.py to identify the crystal plane indices corresponding to the diffraction peaks.
Step 3: Use XXX.py to perform a bond density scan on the specified crystal planes obtained in Step 2.
